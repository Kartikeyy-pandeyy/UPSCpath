      question: "What is the eligibility criteria for UPSC?",
      answer: "To appear for UPSC CSE, candidates must hold a bachelor's degree from any recognized university. The age limit is 21-32 years for General category (as of August 1 of exam year), with relaxations of 5 years for SC/ST, 3 years for OBC, and 10 years for PwBD candidates. There are also nationality requirements - Indian citizenship is mandatory for IAS/IPS, while some services allow Nepalese/Bhutanese citizens.",

    },
    {
      question: "How many attempts are allowed?",
      answer: "The number of attempts varies by category: General category candidates get 6 attempts, OBC candidates (non-creamy layer) get 9 attempts, while SC/ST candidates have unlimited attempts until they reach the upper age limit. For Persons with Benchmark Disabilities (PwBD), General/OBC get 9 attempts and SC/ST PwBD have no limit. An attempt is counted only if you appear for at least one paper in Prelims.",

    {
      question: "What is the best optional subject?",
      answer: "The 'best' optional subject depends on your academic background and interest. Popular choices include Public Administration (overlaps with GS), Geography (scoring with diagrams), Sociology (conceptual), and History (fact-based). Technical subjects like Mathematics can score high if you're comfortable with them. Analyze syllabus overlap, resource availability, and previous years' trends before choosing.",

    },
    {
      question: "What is the exam pattern for UPSC CSE?",
      answer: "UPSC CSE has three stages: 1) Preliminary Exam (two objective papers - GS and CSAT, qualifying nature), 2) Mains Exam (9 descriptive papers including Essay, GS I-IV, Optional papers, and language papers), and 3) Personality Test (interview). The entire process takes about a year from Prelims notification to final results.",
      category: "Exam Pattern"
    },
    {
      question: "How should I prepare for current affairs?",
      answer: "Focus on 12-18 months of current affairs for Prelims. Read The Hindu/Indian Express editorials daily, follow monthly magazines like Yojana/Kurukshetra, and compile notes by themes (Polity, Economy, Environment). For Mains, connect current events with static syllabus. Use government sources (PIB, PRS) and limit resources to avoid overload.",
